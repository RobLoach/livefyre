The Livefyre module allows for Livefyre comments to be inserted into your page.
Currently, they can be inserted into a node ('Content Area') or a Block ('Block').

Note:  This module should be considered a beta since I still have some unanswered questions out to the fine folks at Livefyre.

Installation
------------

Copy the livefyre.module to your contributed modules directory (probably '/sites/all/modules'
and not your '/modules' file because that would be bad) and then enable on the admin
modules page.  Next, find the 'Livefyre' menu item under 'Site Configuration' or just go to this page:  admin/settings/livefyre
