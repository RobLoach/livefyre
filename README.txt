Simple Installation
====================

1. Download and install the Livefyre module into your modules directory
(sites/all/modules).
2. Enable the module at "YOUR-SITENAME.COM/admin/modules"
3. Register your site at http://livefyre.com
4. Visit "YOUR-SITENAME.COM/admin/config/livefyre" and set your configuration options depending on
what you registered with on Livefyre.

This module inserts Livefyre comments into your site via javascript. Currently,
this module allows 2 choices where you can place your Livefyre comments:

    -in a node's 'Content Area'
    -in a 'Block'

If you choose 'Block', you will then need to navigate to "YOUR-SITENAME.COM/admin/structure/block" and search for the "Livefyre Comments" block.  (If this is the first time you've enabled Livefyre Comments it will be somewhere under the "Disabled" heading.)

You can now choose to place your Livefyre Comments block in any of your site's regions (e.g.Header, Footer, etc.).  Make sure you save your Block settings (i.e. click the 'Save' button) after choosing your block configuration.
